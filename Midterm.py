#Function fileLength(), given to you, takes the name of a file as input and returns the length of the file:
#fileLength('midterm.py') 284 fileLength('idterm.py') Traceback (most recent call last): File "<pyshell#34>", line 1, in fileLength('idterm.py') File "/Users/me/midterm.py", line 3, in fileLength infile = open(filename) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'idterm.py' As shown above, if the file cannot be found by the interpreter or if it cannot be read as a text file, an exception will be raised. Modify function fileLength() so that a friendly message is printed instead: fileLength('midterm.py') 358 fileLength('idterm.py') File idterm.py not found.
